# PCA and K Means Clustering 

his project demonstrates dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** followed by unsupervised clustering with **K-Means**. It's designed to explore the effectiveness of clustering high-dimensional data after reducing its dimensions.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Reduce the dimensionality of a dataset using PCA
- Apply K-Means clustering on the reduced data
- Visualize the clusters and analyze results
- Understand the trade-offs between explained variance and clustering accuracy

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
